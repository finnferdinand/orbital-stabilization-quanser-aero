# Observer design

[Return to Chapter 4](../Chapter%204.md)

This folder contains the symbolic computations used to find the linearization of the dynamics needed for the Extended Kalman filter design.

It also contains the Simulink diagrams used for comparing the estimates of the Kalman filter with the second-order low-pass filter.
